# GRSwithDiversity

This repository implements a Group Recommendation System with Diversity on recommended items. The work done here is from my M.Sc degree at UFBA, from 2018 until 2020.

### Instructions

The code is build in python, and in order to run it you need to have python 3.6 or higher settled in your machine. If you need help to do so, I recommend check [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) where you can install multiple python versions and set a virtaul environment.

Once you have python 3.6 settled, you need to install the libraries used in this work. I recommend to do so in an virtual environment. Simply run:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-surprise
```

Finally, execute the script:

`python3 main.py`
